# Pirate Intelligent Agent Project
# Project Overview
In this project, I developed a pirate intelligent agent using reinforcement learning techniques. I was given a basic framework and code for the environment, which I built upon. My contributions included implementing the Q-learning algorithm, designing a neural network for decision-making, and creating training routines to evaluate the agent's performance in the simulated environment.

# Connection to Computer Science
Computer scientists play a vital role in solving complex problems across various domains by leveraging algorithms and data structures. My approach to problem-solving involves clearly defining the challenge, researching existing solutions, implementing code, and reflecting on the results to improve future iterations. This project exemplifies how theoretical concepts can be applied to practical scenarios.

# Ethical Responsibilities
As a computer scientist, I recognize my ethical responsibilities, including prioritizing user needs, ensuring transparency in my algorithms, and protecting user data privacy. These principles guide my work and contribute to the development of trustworthy technology.
